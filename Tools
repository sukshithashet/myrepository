Tools for Product Management:-
Product Management involves a variety of tasks, from ideation to development and release.Several tools creater to different aspects of the product management process.
The tools used in Product Management are:
JIRA- Jira is a versatile tool that supports agile project management. It is widely used for issue and project tracking, allowing teams to plan, track and manage their work. Jira integrates with various plugins and extensions to support product management processes.
Asana- Asana is a work management platform that facilitates collaboration and task tracking and team communication. Asana is suitable for organising and managing product development workflows.
Trello- Trello is a visual collaboration tool that uses boards, lists, and cards to organise tasks and projects. It's simple to use and flexible, making it popular for both agile and non- agile product management approaches.
Product board- Product board is a product management system that helps team understand user needs, prioritize features and create roadmaps. It provides a centralized place for collecting and analyzing user feedback, feature requests and product ideas.

Tools for Source code Management/versioning:-
Git- Git is one of the most popular distributed version control systems. Developed by Linus Torvalds. It is known for its speed, flexibility, and decentralized nature. Git allows multiple developers to work on a project simultaneously and supports branching and merging effectively that host Git repositories and provide additonal collaboration features.
Subversion(SVN)- It is a centralized version control system. It maintains a centralized repository and developers check out a copy of code, make changes and commit them back to the repository. While not as distributed as Git, SVN is known for its simplicity and ease of use. It's often used in enterprise settings.
Mercurial- It is another distributed version control system similar to Git. It is designed to be easy to use and efficient, making it a good choice for projects of various sizes.While it is not as widely used as Git, Mercurial has a dedicated user base and is known for its simpliciy and scalability.

Tools for CI/CD (Continuous Integration and Continuous Deliver/deployment):-
Jenkins- Jenkins is an open source automation server that supports building, deploying, and automating any project.
